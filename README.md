# IGCD Enhancements

This user script for [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) enhances the experience on the Internet Game Cars Database (IGCD) website. It provides the following features:

* **Shows vehicle make logo:** Displays the logo of the vehicle's make next to the title for easier identification.
* **Makes title elements (year, make, model) and additional info (Surname, Chassis, Extra info) clickable:** Turns these text elements into clickable links for quick searches on IGCD.

## Usage

Once installed, the script will automatically run on any page matching `*://*.igcd.net/vehicle.php?id=*`. Simply navigate to a vehicle page on IGCD, and the enhancements will be visible.
* Click on the vehicle make logo next to the title to search for that information.
* Click on the **make** or **model** within the vehicle title to search for that information.
* Click on the text following **Surname**, **Chassis**, or **Extra info** to search for that information.
* Test the script here, on the [1998 Ford Crown Victoria](https://igcd.net/vehicle.php?id=50386).



## Changelog

**Version 1.0 - First Release**

* Allows individual clicks on the logo, make, model, Surname, Chassis, and Extra info, directing users to the corresponding search page on IGCD.



## Known Bugs

* **Logo ambiguity for same name from different countries:** The script currently displays a single logo for a vehicle make, even if there are brands with the same name originating from different countries (e.g., [Puma from Brazil](https://igcd.net/marque.php?id=Puma&pays=BR) and [Puma from Italy](https://igcd.net/marque.php?id=Puma&pays=IT)).
* Clicking on certain logos with special characters, such as [ƒêuro ƒêakoviƒá](https://igcd.net/vehicle.php?id=245829), may result in an error. This is due to the structure of IGCD, and this script can't resolve that.
