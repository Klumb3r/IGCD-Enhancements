# IGCD Enhancements

This user script for [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) enhances the experience on the Internet Game Cars Database (IGCD) website. It provides the following features:

* **Shows vehicle make logo:** Displays the logo of the vehicle's make next to the title for easier identification.
* **Makes title elements (year, make, model) and additional info (Surname, Chassis, Extra info) clickable:** Turns these text elements into clickable links for quick searches on IGCD.

## Known Bugs

* Currently, the makes "**[American Bridge Co.](https://igcd.net/marque.php?id=American+Bridge+Co.&pays=US)**", "**[American Car Company](https://igcd.net/marque.php?id=American+Car+Company&pays=US)**", "**[American Coal Enterprises](https://igcd.net/marque.php?id=American+Coal+Enterprises&pays=US)**", and "**[American Ship Building Company](https://igcd.net/marque.php?id=American+Ship+Building+Company&pays=US)**" don't have their own logos, the script mistakenly displays the logo for the "**[American](https://igcd.net/marque.php?id=American&pays=US)**" make instead. Since IGCD doesn't distinguish between make and model in its storage system, I have to scrape the page and try to match any existing logos. In these cases, it only finds and returns "**[American](https://igcd.net/marque.php?id=American&pays=US)**". The same issue occurs with "**[Derby Works](https://igcd.net/marque.php?id=Derby+Works&pays=UK)**" with "**[Derby](https://igcd.net/marque.php?id=Derby&pays=FR)**", "**[Bell Boeing](https://igcd.net/marque.php?id=Bell+Boeing&pays=US)**" with "**[Bell](https://igcd.net/marque.php?id=Bell&pays=US)**", "**[Lake Shore](https://igcd.net/marque.php?id=Lake+Shore&pays=US)**" with "**[Lake](https://igcd.net/marque.php?id=Lake&pays=US)**", "**[Bristol Boats](https://igcd.net/marque.php?id=Bristol+Boats&pays=UK)**" with "**[Bristol](https://igcd.net/marque.php?id=Bristol&pays=UK)**", etc.
* For "**Devel Sixteen**", the script merges the make and model because, for some reason, there is a file named "[Devel Sixteen.png](https://igcd.net/logos/Devel%20Sixteen.png)". The proper solution would be to remove this file from the database.
* Makes that start with numbers, such as "[**23 August Works**](https://igcd.net/marque.php?id=23+August+Works&pays=RO)", will display an incorrect logo because in IGCD V4 the logos are named with numbers.
